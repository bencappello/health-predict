## 2025-05-06 15:21:28 - Initial Terraform Setup (Phase 1 IaC)

- Created initial Terraform configuration files in `iac/` directory (`versions.tf`, `variables.tf`, `main.tf`, `outputs.tf`).
  - `main.tf` includes basic setup for: VPC, Public Subnet, Internet Gateway, Security Group, IAM Role & Policies (for S3 & ECR access), EC2 Instance (t2.micro with User Data for Docker/Compose/Git), S3 Bucket (versioned), ECR Repository.
- Created `project_docs/terraform_guide.md` with detailed instructions for the user to:
  - Customize variables (especially `your_ip` and EC2 `key_name`).
  - Run `terraform init`, `plan`, and `apply`.
  - Verify resources and retrieve outputs.
  - SSH into the EC2 instance.
  - Crucially, run `terraform destroy` to manage costs.
- Updated `project_steps.md` to reflect these initial IaC tasks and point to the guide.
