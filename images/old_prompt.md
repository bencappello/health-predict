**Solution Overview**

   * Depict the full AWS-based MLOps architecture:

     * **Data Sources**: Diabetes dataset (S3)
     * **Infrastructure**: EC2 hosting MLOps services (Airflow, MLflow, Ray Tune), Terraform-managed resources
     * **Data Storage & Artifacts**: S3 buckets for raw/processed data and serialized models, ECR container registry
     * **Compute & Orchestration**: Airflow DAGs orchestrating training (with Ray Tune HPO) and deployment pipelines
     * **Model Serving**: Kubernetes (Minikube) cluster running FastAPI endpoints with rolling updates
     * **Monitoring & Drift Detection**: Evidently AI integration triggering retraining DAGs
     * **CI/CD**: Automated build/test/deploy pipelines connecting GitHub, ECR, and Kubernetes
   * Label each segment with service names, arrows for data and control flow, and appropriate icons.

2. **Data Pipeline & Feature Engineering**

   * Illustrate data ingestion and preprocessing:

     * **Raw Data**: S3 bucket ingestion of diabetes patient records
     * **Preprocessing**: Transformation pipeline handling missing values, encoding, normalization
     * **Feature Engineering**: Derived features for model inputs
     * **Data Partitioning**: Branching for training (20%) vs. simulation/future data (80%)
     * **Storage**: Storing processed partitions back to S3
   * Show Airflow `training_pipeline_dag.py` tasks and MLflow logging steps.

3. **Training, Deployment & Retraining Pipeline**

   * Detail the model lifecycle managed by Airflow:

     * **Training DAG**:

       * Task for **distributed HPO** with Ray Tune
       * **MLflow** experiment logging and model registry promotion
     * **Deployment DAG**:

       * **Docker image build** embedding the best model
       * **Push to ECR** and **kubectl rolling update** on Minikube
       * **API Tests** via FastAPI readiness/liveness probes
     * **Drift Detection DAG**:

       * **Evidently AI** statistical checks (PSI, KS-test)
       * **Trigger retraining** upon threshold breach
   * Use color-coded arrows: training (blue), deployment (green), monitoring/retraining (red).
