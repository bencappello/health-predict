* Use **soft, light color-coded sections** reflecting component ownership (e.g., AWS orange, Docker blue, S3 cyan, Kubernetes teal, Python purple, monitoring red).
* Maintain **ample white space** for visual separation.
* Employ **modular box layouts** with **refined rounded corners** and **comfortable proportions**.
* Use **delicate, labeled connector arrows** to depict data flow and control flow.
* Ensure a **light, airy** overall feel with a clear hierarchy of information.

## Technical Specifications

1. **Orientation & Size**: Horizontal layout, minimum **1000Ã—500 px** canvas, suitable for embedding in a GitHub README.

## Task

Using the content from the attached README.md:
- Create a markdown document, systems_outline.md, that outlines in writing basic information flow and architecture of the following three parts of the overall system:
    - 1: High level overview of the project.
    - 2: Model Training & Deployment Pipeline
    - 3: Monitoring & Retraining System.
- Pulling from systems_outline.md, follow the **design style** and **technical specifications** to generate **a markdown file** design specifications for diagrams for each of the 3 systems. Use the attached images for style insipiration to guide your design of the diagrams but make sure the content of the diagrams is pulled exclusively from systems_outline.md.
- Generate the python code for the first diagram using **Diagrams python library** and save it to a file.
