<img src="images/readme_hero.png" alt="Diagram" width="500"/>

## Overview

**Health Predict** is a comprehensive MLOps system designed to predict the risk of patient readmission in healthcare settings. This project implements a complete machine learning lifecycle from data ingestion to automated retraining, with a focus on robust MLOps practices and production-grade deployment.

This system addresses the critical healthcare challenge of patient readmission, which not only burdens healthcare systems financially but also indicates potential gaps in patient care quality. By accurately predicting readmission risk, healthcare providers can implement targeted interventions, improving patient outcomes while optimizing resource allocation.

## Business Problem

Patient readmission—the return of a patient to the hospital shortly after discharge—represents both a significant healthcare quality issue and a financial burden:

- Hospital readmissions cost the U.S. healthcare system approximately $26 billion annually
- Readmissions often indicate unresolved health issues or inadequate post-discharge support
- CMS penalizes hospitals for excessive readmission rates through the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program
- Early identification of at-risk patients enables proactive interventions

Health Predict addresses this challenge by leveraging machine learning to predict which patients are most likely to be readmitted, allowing for targeted interventions before discharge and during follow-up care.

## Solution Architecture

The Health Predict system implements a complete MLOps lifecycle on AWS infrastructure, employing cost-effective design choices to demonstrate enterprise-level capabilities while maintaining budget efficiency:

### Key Components:

1. **AWS Infrastructure**
   - EC2 for hosting core MLOps services
   - S3 for data and artifact storage
   - ECR for container image registry
   - Cost-optimized design using containerization on single EC2 instead of managed services

2. **MLOps Platform**
   - **Data Management**: AWS S3 for raw and processed data storage
   - **Model Training & HPO**: Ray Tune for distributed hyperparameter optimization
   - **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow for comprehensive experiment tracking and model registry
   - **Model Serving**: FastAPI for REST API endpoints, deployed on Kubernetes
   - **Orchestration**: Apache Airflow for workflow automation
   - **Monitoring**: Evidently AI for data and concept drift detection
   - **CI/CD**: Automated build and deployment pipelines

3. **Kubernetes Deployment**
   - Minikube for local K8s cluster on EC2 (cost-effective approach)
   - Containerized model serving with auto-scaling capabilities
   - Rolling deployment strategy for zero-downtime updates

4. **Drift Detection & Retraining**
   - Automated monitoring for data and concept drift
   - Time-series simulation of production data for drift detection
   - Automated retraining when significant drift is detected

## Technical Implementation

### Data Pipeline & Feature Engineering

> The integrated Training and Deployment pipeline, orchestrated by Airflow, automates the journey from raw data to a production-ready model:
> *   **Training Phase**: Raw data from S3 is processed and used by Ray Tune for HPO and training multiple model types. MLflow tracks experiments and registers the best-performing model (based on F1 score) to the "Production" stage.
> *   **Deployment Phase**: The "Production" model is retrieved from MLflow, packaged into a Docker container with the FastAPI application, pushed to ECR, and then deployed to Kubernetes via a rolling update. Automated tests ensure the new deployment's integrity.

### Training Pipeline with Hyperparameter Optimization
The training pipeline leverages distributed computing for efficient model development:

- **Orchestration**: Airflow DAG (`training_pipeline_dag.py`) manages the end-to-end process
- **Models**: Multiple model types (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression)
- **HPO**: Ray Tune for scalable hyperparameter optimization with early stopping
- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow for logging parameters, metrics, and artifacts
- **Model Selection**: Automated selection of best model based on F1 score
- **Model Registry**: Automatic promotion to production in MLflow registry

### Deployment Pipeline
The deployment pipeline automates the transition from model training to production:

- **Orchestration**: Airflow DAG (`deployment_pipeline_dag.py`) manages the deployment process
- **Container Building**: Automated Docker image building with the latest model
- **Registry**: Pushing images to Amazon ECR
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Updating the K8s deployment with rolling updates
- **Testing**: Automated API endpoint testing post-deployment
- **Monitoring**: Setup of monitoring for the newly deployed model

### Model Serving API

The model serving API provides reliable and efficient prediction services:

- **Framework**: FastAPI for high-performance REST API
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated Swagger/OpenAPI docs
- **Model Loading**: Dynamic loading from MLflow registry
- **Preprocessing**: Consistent preprocessing pipeline with the training process
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error reporting
- **Health Checks**: Endpoint for K8s readiness/liveness probes

### Drift Detection & Retraining

The monitoring system ensures model performance over time:

- **Data Partitioning**: 20% of data for initial training, 80% reserved to simulate future data
- **Drift Detection**: Evidently AI for statistical monitoring of data and concept drift
- **Drift Metrics**: PSI, KS-test, and other statistical measures for different feature types
- **Automated Response**: Triggering retraining pipeline when drift exceeds thresholds
- **Visualization**: Dashboards for tracking drift metrics over time
